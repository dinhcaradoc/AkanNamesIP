      <p>Welcome to the Akan names page. Akan names are Ghanaian traditional names which are given to a person based on a number of factors. 
        The Akan naming system considers the day of the week on which the person was born. The system includes separate names for each gender.
        Thus, you can easily get your Akan name if you know the day of the week on which you were born.</p>
      <p>A list of Akan names has been provided below. You can simply pick your Akan name based on the day of the week on which you were born. In case you are not certain about the day, you can use our Akan Names generator instead.</p>
